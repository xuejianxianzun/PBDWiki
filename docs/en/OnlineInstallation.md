## Android

You can now install this extension offline using the Microsoft Edge Canary browser. For specific steps, please refer to:

*Previously, the Kiwi browser on Android supported online installation of this extension, but it has stopped development and been removed from Google Play, so it is no longer recommended.*

------------

Although Firefox on Android supports installing extensions, it seems to only allow extensions marked as "optimized for mobile." This extension is currently not on that list, so it cannot be installed or used.

## iOS

!> Not Supported

Safari on iOS seems to only allow extensions to be installed from the App Store, so this extension cannot be used.
